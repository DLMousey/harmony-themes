# harmony-themes
A repository of CSS themes for Harmony

## Install a theme

**Auto-install**: Open Harmony's settings, and simply copy-paste the raw .css file url in Harmony then hit *install*. 
For example `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vincelwt/harmony-themes/master/dark.css`

**Manual install**: Simply put the .css in:
- `%APPDATA%/Harmony/Themes/` on Windows
- `~/.config/Harmony/Themes/` on Linux
- `~/Library/Application Support/Harmony/Themes/` on macOS
 
 
To use the theme you have to select it in Harmony's settings.

## Submit a theme

Feel free to submit your themes as pull-requests.

I recommend you to use `dark.css` as a base to create your theme.

You can use the developer tools to help make your theme, enable it with `Ctrl+Alt+i` .

** Please avoid the use of !important **
